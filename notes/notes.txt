error in nrCDLChannel line 1871, The number of elements in all delay profile fields (PathDelays, AveragePathGains, AnglesAoD, AnglesAoA, AnglesZoD, AnglesZoA) must be the same. 

Error is caused by ConfigChannel step 6, where clusters with less than -25dB power compared to maximum cluster power are removed. 
This will cause the number of elements in PathDelays to be higher than the other terms. 
quick fix for now, disable the remove -25dB lower clusters feature. 
possible fixes for the future, remove the corresponding PathDelays as well?

error is in hNRUEPHY, line 855, obj.maxChannelDelay is too large
obj.maxchanneldelay is calculated at the end of constructor
chInfo.Pathdelays is too large, generated by chInfo = info(obj.channelmodel)

the dimension and values of delays are changed here. 

quick fix:

Change the number of strongest clusters to 0. 


error in nrChannelEstimate line 1320, the number of OFDM symbols of the received grid (15) must be equal to the number of OFDM symbols in one slot (14)
rxGrid is produced in hNRUEPhy.m line 946, nrOFDMDemodulate
the extra symbol seems to be caused by the large pathdelay, found by inspection, the UE with 15 symbols has unusual large pathdelay, ~800 as compared to under 100

quick fix:
when generating pathdelay, tau_n, limit the range of X to be 0.5~1, to reduced to size of tau_n


error in hNRMACPDUParser line 120, index exceeds the number of array elements
not sure what happened, but seems to be caused by the 38.901 pathloss in GNBPHY, switching back to freespace the problem goes away
UEPHY with 38.901 pathloss is okay

quick fix: freespace pathloss for gNB for now, maybe SINR plot is not affected, cuz it is downlink only?
